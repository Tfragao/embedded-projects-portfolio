# embedded-projects-portfolio
This repository showcases a collection of embedded systems projects developed to demonstrate practical experience in embedded security, hardware interfacing, and modern embedded Linux workflows.
# Key Features
    - Diverse Hardware Platforms: Projects using BeagleBone Black, STM32F4, and LPC55S16-EvK.

    - Security-Focused: Secure bootloaders, TrustZone demos, and cryptographic firmware verification.

    - Protocol Implementations: Hands-on work with RS232, SPI, and I2C, including from-scratch implementations.

    - Modern Embedded Linux: Integration with Yocto, swupdate, and secure update mechanisms.

    - Professional Practices: Well-documented code, automated tests (Google Test for C/C++), and architecture diagrams.

    - Portfolio-Ready: Each project folder includes setup instructions, technical documentation, and highlights of security features.
